Hi! My name is CJ. I am a programmer and sound-design nerd.

I've always had a deep emotional connection with music, and was fortunate to have the opportunity to self teach guitar from an early age. I attended 2 years of college for music production, which covered midi, studio operation, audio engineering, music fundamentals, and some piano.

During my time in school, searching for my production style, I discovered a love for synthesis. I found myself immersed in the UK bass music production scene, following artists like KOAN Sound and Joe Ford. I saw an ocean of difference between the UK sounds and the American EDM that my peers listened to, and saw an opportunity to contribute something new to the scene.

Over the last 8 years, I invested an ocean of time exploring synthesis, and invested all of my earnings into learning sound-design from established professionals. I realized early on that my own learning would be infinite, as the craft is never ending. So to better support continued learning, I took to teaching sound-design/synthesis one-on-one.

I created this blog to talk about and demonstrate sound-design and synthesis. I will also have series of posts that deal with software and hardware reviews, and genre education. My hope is that exposure to this information will propel readers to find a strong desire for mastery in this field.

As for programming.. I have experience in web design and app design, using React, React-Native, Javascript, AWS, and others. I am mentored and self taught, but about to start a structured education at a bootcamp. My portfolio is small because I have focused all of my energy on the app project which can be found at my [GitHub](https://github.com/CjDupre). There you will find the front end of the ScreenCache app, and the AWS back end. I am currently open to employment offers.
